I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at UC Santa Barbara.

I work on applied theory topics related to environmental policy and regulation. My current research focuses on the distributional effects of improved information for making regulatory decisions, the timing of environmental policy changes, and the role of information in coordination and cooperation.

Prior to starting my Ph.D. I worked at <a style='color: black;' href='http://edf.org'> Environmental Defense Fund</a> synthesizing and conducting research related to fisheries policy. I recieved my B.S. in Economics from the <a style='color: black;' href = 'https://economics.uoregon.edu'> University of Oregon</a>.
